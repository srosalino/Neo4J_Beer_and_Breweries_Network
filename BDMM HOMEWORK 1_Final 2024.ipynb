    "_For reference the dataset used for this project has been extracted from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews), released by Evan Hallmark. Even though the author does not present metadata on the origin of the data it is probably a collection of open data from places like [beeradvocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/)_.\n",

    "    3. Users are connected together by their reviews of beers, taking into consideration the \"overall\" score they assign as a weight, how many communities are formed from these relationships?

    "**Justification**\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a recommendation for someone who typically enjoys a beer due to its aroma and appearance, the recommendation algorithm focuses on two key aspects from the reviews: the smell and the look ratings. These aspects are highly relevant to the sensory experience of beer, which directly aligns with the user's stated preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a justification for the approach taken by the recommendation algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus on Relevant Factors**: Since the user's enjoyment is primarily driven by aroma (smell) and appearance (look), the algorithm selectively considers only these two factors from the reviews. This ensures that the recommendation is based on attributes that are most important to the user's experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of Averaging:** By averaging the smell and look ratings across all reviews for beers of a particular style, the algorithm derives a composite score that represents the overall sensory appeal of each beer style. This aggregation method effectively summarizes the collective opinion of the beer community regarding these sensory characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Handling Non-Numeric Values:** The algorithm includes a safeguard to ensure data quality by converting ratings to floats and excluding entries where the smell or look rating is not a number (NaN). This step prevents the algorithm from being skewed by invalid or missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Efficient Comparison:** By comparing the ratings as floats instead of strings, the algorithm enhances its performance. This is a crucial step, considering the potentially large volume of reviews that must be processed, should the database scale even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distinct Styles and Highest Score:** The algorithm returns the name of the beer style with the highest average score for the combined smell and look ratings. By focusing on all distinct styles, it ensures that the maximum diverse range of beer experiences is considered, and by ordering by the score, it identifies the style that best matches the user's preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limiting Results:** The query limits the result to the top beer style to provide a clear and singular recommendation, making the decision process simpler for the user."

    "**Justification**\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendation algorithm is designed to provide personalized beer suggestions based on individual user preferences concerning three key beer characteristics: look, smell, and taste. These attributes are widely recognized as significant factors affecting a person's enjoyment of beer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a detailed justification for the recommendation algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Personalization through User Input:**\n",
    "The algorithm starts by engaging with the user to gather personalized data. It prompts the user to select their country, ensuring that recommended beers are locally available. This geographical consideration narrows down the scope of the search to a relevant subset of beers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Characteristics:**\n",
    "To capture the user's preference, the algorithm asks them to rank the importance of look, smell, and taste on a scale of 1 to 3, with 1 being the most important. This ranking is then inverted to serve as weights (with a higher ranking leading to a higher weight) to reflect the user's preference in the scoring system ‚Äî the most cherished characteristic has the greatest influence on the recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Aggregated Review Data:**\n",
    "The algorithm leverages aggregated review data from other users to inform its suggestions. It computes a weighted average score for each beer based on historical review data, where the look, smell, and taste scores from reviews are multiplied by the user's corresponding weights. Only reviews with valid data are considered, ensuring reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scoring and Ranking:**\n",
    "Each beer is scored by summing the weighted average scores of look, smell, and taste. The final score represents an aggregate assessment of each beer's alignment with the user's stated preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top Recommendations:**\n",
    "The algorithm sorts all beers by their computed scores in descending order. The top three beers, which are the best match for the user's preferences, are then presented as recommendations. This approach offers a concise and focused selection for the user to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaptation to Diverse Preferences:**\n",
    "By adjusting weights based on user input, the algorithm is flexible and easily adapts to a wide range of taste profiles. Whether a user values the aroma over appearance or taste over aroma, the recommendations will reflect these preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Streamlined User Experience:**\n",
    "The algorithm's use of widgets and dropdowns for input collection provides a user-friendly interface. The direct and straightforward interaction does not overwhelm the user with choices but guides them through a simple process to collect essential preference data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance Considerations:**\n",
    "The algorithm efficiently queries the database and processes data. By using Cypher queries tailored to perform calculations within the database engine, it avoids the overhead of transferring large data sets for external processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To sum up, the algorithm stands on the principles of personalization, data-driven insights, and user experience. It understands the user's unique taste, leverages community data for informed recommendations, and presents a friendly interface for interaction. The output is a set of three beers, each likely to please the user based on the intricate balance of look, smell, and taste that they have prioritized."
